## Project Description 
This is a daily planner application that helps employees manage their busy schedules. 
The application allows users to add important events to their daily planner, and it helps them to manage their time effectively.


## Story

As an individual with a busy work schedule, I need a daily planner application that allows me to add important events, so I can effectively manage my time.

## About 

When I am using the daily planner to organize my schedule, and I open the planner, the current day should be displayed at the top of the calendar. As I scroll down, I should be presented with time blocks for standard business hours. When I view the time blocks for that day, each block should be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. If I click into a time block, I can enter an event. Upon clicking the save button for that time block, the text for that event should be saved in local storage. Additionally, when I refresh the page, the saved events should persist
